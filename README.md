# YinYang
Python based game of Find The Difference 

General Information
---------------------

YinYang is an application for finding differences in two similar pictures - like the puzzle series created by Henry Boltinoff. 

It finds the differences in the two pictures, which are otherwise very similar to each other, and marks those areas of difference.

File Types and Specifications
-------------------------------

The input image file should preferably be of JPEG or PNG format (We recommend PNG format).

The image should be homomorphic to Henry Boltinoff's puzzles - two picture panels juxtaposed vertically or horizontally.

Requirements
-------------

The code is written in Python 3.5.1. User needs to have the following packages installed within the Python environment -

-PyQt5
-OpenCV 3.2 or higher (with contrib) (Download from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)

Usage
------

 
- The user simply needs to browse for the appropriate image file by pressing on the 'Browse' button.

- Once the image is loaded and the two similar picture panels are shown side by side, press on "Show" to see the differences.

- The "Hide" button is for going back to view of the original picture panels.


Disclaimer
-----------

This application is for finding the potential differences in the two otherwise very similar pictures. If the picture panels are aligned perfectly - 

with no uneven warp or distortion, only true differences can be obtained. However in case of such imperfections, some false positives may occur 

which are up to the user's discretion to choose.
